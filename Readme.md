# LSTM Stock Predictor Using Closing Prices vs FNG
## ANSWERS

### 1. Prediction model using closing prices has lower loss

### 2. Prediction model using closing prices tracks better predicton results over time

### 3. Window size of 1D tracks better prediction results compared with other window ranges from 2-10 days for both the models. However, the 1D window prediction under FNG model had more volatility in prediction model compared with 10D window size. For preidiction under closing_Price model, 1D window showed the best results in tracking real prices and as the window size got bigger than 1D till 6D, the divergence of predicted prices vs real prices got bigger and then from 7D onwards divergance of predicted prices vs real prices remained somehow close to consstant.
